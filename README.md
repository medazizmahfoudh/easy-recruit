# EasyRecruit - Automated Recruitment and Training Workflow

**EasyRecruit** is a business process management system that automates recruitment and training workflows using advanced technologies. This project utilizes tools such as **Camunda**, **LangChain4j**, **Quarkus**, and the **Foreign Function and Memory API** to streamline decision-making, automate repetitive tasks, and improve the overall efficiency of human resource management.

## Features
1. **Automated Application Evaluation**:
   - Utilizes LangChain4j to analyze and assess candidate applications.
   - Automatically decides whether a candidate is rejected or moved to the next stage.

2. **Interview Scheduling**:
   - Leverages Quarkus to manage and schedule interviews for qualified candidates.

3. **Candidate Interview Process**:
   - Incorporates the Foreign Function and Memory API to optimize memory usage and enhance performance during interview assessments.

4. **Training Recommendations**:
   - Suggests potential training programs for candidates using Micronaut, based on identified weaknesses during interviews.

5. **Email Notifications**:
   - Sends automated rejection or acceptance emails to candidates.

## Workflow Overview
The project is structured into two management lanes:
1. **Human Resources Recruitment Management**:
   - Handles candidate evaluation, interview planning, and email notifications.
2. **Trainings Management**:
   - Identifies and recommends training programs for candidates with skill gaps.

## Technologies Used
- **Camunda**: Workflow and decision automation.
- **LangChain4j**: Natural language processing for application evaluation.
- **Quarkus**: High-performance Java framework for interview scheduling.
- **Foreign Function and Memory API**: Optimized memory handling during interviews.
- **Micronaut**: Lightweight framework for training suggestions.

## How It Works
